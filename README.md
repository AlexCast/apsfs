### Atmospheric Point Spread Function simulation

This R package contains functions to calculate the atmopsheric point spread function (PSF) for a given geometry and atmospheric composition and profile, and functions to fit the simulations to uni or bidimensional models.

The PSF is calculated with backward Monte Carlo with the following simplifications:
* Plane paralel geometry;
* Layered medium;
* Lambertian surface;
* Elastic scattering;
* Molecular absorption (included but must be supplied externally).

Polarization, inelastic scattering and atmospheric turbulence are not included.

Simulations can be recorded in a annular geometry (unidimensional) for symmetric conditions (Lambertian surfaces and sensor looking at nadir). For asymmetric conditions (surface BRDF and/or zenith view angles away from nadir) the sectorial (radius, azimuth) and grid (x, y) geometries are available.

The results can then be fitted to models to provide flexibility for application. Cumulative annular data is fitted to a three term exponential function and can include pressure dependence. Cumulative sectorial data is fitted with bidimensional model with exponential term for radius and polynomial term for azimuth and can include view angle dependence. Grid data can be fitted with Zernike polynomials.

A C compiler is necessary to access the C version of the Monte Carlo code. A (much slower) R version of the code is also provided.

This package was written for personal use. It is well documented and is sufficiently 
generic that might be of use to others. It is provided as is, without warranties.

### Install from Github:

The package depends on packages magrittr and numDeriv and on the unpublished package rho.

```
# install.packages(c("remotes", "magrittr", "numDeriv"))
# remotes::install_github("AlexCast/rho")
remotes::install_github("AlexCast/apsfs")
```
