\title{Calculates the mixed second partial derivative:  d^2 * z / dx * dy 
for a scalar valued function (z) of two arguments (x, y). This is the 
bidimensional density function, the underlying process integrated by Monte 
Carlo, sub-sequentially used to calculate the bidimensional cumulative 
distribution function fitted by fit_sectorial or fit_grid.}
\usage{
.get_d2psf_dxdy(func, x1, x2, ...)
}
\description{
The code is modified from numDeriv:::genD. The original function is generic 
and vectorized in the sense of a vector valued function. It was adpated here 
to solve a scalar valued function at several coordinates at the same time for 
reasons of computational efficiency. The modifications below make this 
function specific to the problem at hand, in particular the way the 
predict_sectorial subfunctions are expected to work.
